        "The purpose of this project is to forecast the electricity consumption of a particular household in Belgium based on the temperature and humidity levels of various rooms in the facility and surrounding weather information over 4.5 months. The data set runs 4.5 months at 10 minutes. A ZigBee wireless sensor network is being used to monitor the homeâ€™s temperature and humidity levels. Around 3.3 minutes, each wireless node sent the temperature and humidity data. The wireless data was then averaged across intervals of 10 minutes. Every 10 minutes, m-bus energy meters collected the energy data. The experimental data sets were combined with the weather data from the closest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium), which was extracted from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru). The data set has two random variables to test the regression models and exclude non-predictive characteristics (parameters).\n",

It is important to study the energy consuming behaviour in the residential sector and predict the energy consumption by home appliances as it consume maximum amount of energy in the residence. This project focuses on predicting the energy consumption of home appliances based on humidity and temperature."
